As my first step towards being a data analyst, have created my first dashboard on a store dataset using Excel. Excited and nervous at the same time, doved into the project with great enthusiasm.

The first step i took was cleaning the data. Deduplicated the rows, removed any null values and dealt with outliers. He also checked to ensure that all of the data was in the correct format.

Once the data had been cleaned and was ready for analysis, began processing the data. I calculated important metrics such as total sales, units sold, and comapred the sales versus orders, also looked at the top-performing products and identified any patterns or trends.

Next, I started to work on data visualization. Organized the data into tables and charts, using colours and highlighting to draw attention to important data points. Created bar and line charts, pie charts and scatterplots to create visually appealing data visuals that could be easily understood by viewers.

Finally, after getting accustomed to the data through all previous steps, I was able to extract insights. 
Insights : Women are likely to buy compared to men (-66%)
2) Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 States (-35%)
3) Adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max distributing (-50%)
4) Amazon, FLipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing (-80%)

Overall, after going through the process of data cleaning, data processing, data visualization and insights, I have created my first dashboard on a store dataset using Excel with great success.
